# MSDB-Madurai-Smart-Drop-Booth
An IoT-based Smart Waste Management Ecosystem for Madurai, featuring a reward-based segregation system, solar-powered EV-van model, and Python-automated point logic.
# MSDB - Madurai Smart Drop Booth ♻️🔋

**Madurai Smart Drop Booth (MSDB)** is an IoT-based smart waste management system designed to reward citizens for proper waste segregation.

## 🚀 Project Overview
MSDB aims to solve the waste crisis in Madurai by implementing a reward-based system. Users drop waste into designated slots, and based on the weight detected by sensors, they earn points that can be redeemed locally.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Dual Slot System:** Separate large slots for Dry and Wet waste.
- **Smart Authentication:** QR-based user login.
- **Real-time Reward Logic:** Automated point calculation based on waste weight.
- **Solar Powered:** Sustainable energy for the entire booth.
- **Mobility:** Designed as an EV-van model for street-level collection.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Hardware Simulation:** (Load Cells, Ultrasonic Sensors mapping)
- **Concept Design:** 3D Modeling & AI-generated cinematic visualization.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Simulation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/MSDB-SmartBooth.git](https://github.com/your-username/MSDB-SmartBooth.git)
